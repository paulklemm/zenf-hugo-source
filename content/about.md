# Hi! I'm Paul.

I'm a PhD student at the computer science faculty of the University of Magdeburg. I develop visual analytics methods, which combine statistics and visual analysis. The goal is to derive insight into large scale data sets.

I write about day to day tech-problems I encounter as well good practices for certain bits of technology. Hopefully it will benefit you.
