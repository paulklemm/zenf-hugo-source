# Hi! I'm Paul.

I'm a Postdoc at the Max-Planck-Institute for Metabolism Research in Cologne. I develop visual analytics methods, which combine statistics and visual analysis. I want to derive insight into large scale data sets.

I write about day to day tech-problems as well good practices. Hopefully it will benefit you.
