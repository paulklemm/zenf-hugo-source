---

In this post I'd like to show you how to install `Python` with support for `VTK` and `Qt` using Apple OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. Then I set up `Eclipse` with the new `Python` installation in order to use all of it's auto-completion and debugging capabilities. Please leave a comment with your experiences using this.

The instructions for the installation of `Python` and `Qt` consists mostly of information from these two posts [[1]](http://www.thisisthegreenroom.com/2011/installing-python-numpy-scipy-matplotlib-and-ipython-on-lion/) [[2]](http://jbowles.github.com/blog/2012/04/22/python/), so please credit these guys for this, not me.

If you run a Windows or Linux machine and you might want to do yourself a favor and use the [DRE which is included in DeVIDE](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/Projects/DeVIDE).

Install and configure Homebrew
------------------------------
As a very first step you need to install *Homebrew*, the friendly packet manager for Mac OS X [[3]](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). This makes it really easy to install all the necessary stuff. While OS X already ships with versions of `Python`, `Ruby` and other stuff, the versions they provide are often deprecated and installing own packages can be quite frustrating. Homebrew installs all it's stuff isolated from the system under `/usr/local/cellar`. This way you can install your own libraries without touching the components installed from Apple.

In order make sure that Terminal searches the `bin` folder of Homebrew first before the System `bin` folder (which is `/usr/bin`), you need to add it to the `PATH`-variable. This can be done by editing the `.bash_profile` file in you user root folder `/Users/<your username>/.bash_profile` (further referenced as `~/`). If this file doesn't exist, create it! Now you add 
{{< highlight bash >}}
# ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH
{{< /highlight >}}
to the file. The second entry is later used to get the right version of `PIP`.
Note: If you have a Terminal session up and running you need to restart it in order to apply the changes to the `PATH`. If you have trouble with hidden files on the system, [this Tool](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) can come in handy for you!

Before you install anything to Homebrew, be sure to run `brew doctor` and `brew update` to check if all dependencies are installed (`xCode`, `Command Line Tools` and `x11`). When `brew doctor` gives you green light you are good to go!

Install Python
--------------
The very first step is that you install your own version of `Python` by running the following command:
{{< highlight bash >}}
brew install python --framework --universal
{{< /highlight >}}
In order to make it the default `Python` installation of the system you need to execute
{{< highlight bash >}}
cd /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
sudo rm Current
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.2/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current
{{< /highlight >}}
This changes the symlink to our new `Python` installation. You will be promted for you password since this is an action which requires admin rights.

If everything worked, `which python` should return `/usr/local/bin/python`.

Next step is the installation of `PIP` using the command 
{{< highlight bash >}}
easy_install pip
{{< /highlight >}}
Now `which pip` should return `/usr/local/share/python/pip` - otherwise the `PATH` is not properly set as described above.

Now you can install other Packages like `Numpy` or `Scipy` - depending on what you need. Note: If you want to install `Scipy` you need to install the `gfortran` compiler.
{{< highlight bash >}}
pip install numpy
brew install gfortran
pip install scipy
{{< /highlight >}}
Note: To date of this post, you have to use the developer version of `Scipy` to make it work under Mountain Lion. This can be done using
{{< highlight bash >}}
pip install -e git+https://github.com/scipy/scipy#egg=scipy-dev
{{< /highlight >}}
This will create a folder `~/src` and install `Scipy` from there.

Install Qt
----------

To install `Qt` and `Pyqt`-bindings you execute
{{< highlight bash >}}
brew install qt
brew install pyqt
{{< /highlight >}}

Install VTK
-----------
To install VTK you need to run
{{< highlight bash >}}
brew install vtk --tcl --qt --python --pyqt --examples
{{< /highlight >}}
This took about 60 minutes on my early 2008 Macbook Pro, so take your time for a well-earned rest.

When this is done you should be able to `import vtk` into your `Python` environment without any errors.

Setup Python for use with Eclipse
---------------------------------
This part is oriented on the introduction on how to include the `DRE` into `Eclipse`, which can be found under [[4]](http://code.google.com/p/devide/wiki/EclipseDRE) and in the following screencast. I just made a few enhancements to make it work for this application. Note that the steps of the screencast don't work exactly on our installation!
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-b1zS536R2M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To use `Python` together with `Eclipse` you have to install the *Classic* Version from [the official homepage](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). Next, [install PyDev into Eclipse](http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html). Now you need to tell `Eclipse` which `Python` installation it should use. This can be done in `Eclipse → Settings → Pydev → Interpreter-Python → New`. In the next Dialog you have to add Path to the Homebrew `Python`.
{{< figure src="/zenf-hugo/media/2012-08-20-install-python-together-with-vtk-using-homebrew-for-mountain-lion/selectPythonInterpreter.png" >}}
Confirm the next Prompt which should look like the following screenshot and you are done.
{{< figure src="/zenf-hugo/media/2012-08-20-install-python-together-with-vtk-using-homebrew-for-mountain-lion/selectPythonPackages.png" >}}

Now you are good to go. Create a new PyDev Project, select the new created interpreter and play around with `VTK` - it all should be working with auto completion and the other neat `Eclipse` features. The Code example Charl used in the Screencast should compile:
{{< highlight python >}}
# vtkDonutTest.py
import vtk
# create a donut polydata source
s = vtk.vtkSuperquadricSource()
s.ToroidalOn()
# connect it to a polydatamapper
m = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
m.SetInput(s.GetOutput())
# and finally create an actor to represent the donut in the scene
a = vtk.vtkActor()
a.SetMapper(m)

# the renderer is the 3D scene
ren = vtk.vtkRenderer()
ren.AddActor(a)
# renderwindow to contain the 3D scene
rw = vtk.vtkRenderWindow()
rw.AddRenderer(ren)

# we want the user to interact
iren = vtk.vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
iren.SetRenderWindow(rw)

# get the whole business going
iren.Initialize()
rw.Render()
iren.Start()
{{< /highlight >}}

To test the Qt-Support you can run the following code [[5]](https://svn.enthought.com/svn/enthought/Mayavi/trunk/enthought/tvtk/pyface/ui/qt4/QVTKRenderWindowInteractor.py):
{{< highlight python >}}
# vtkQtTest.py
import vtk
from PyQt4 import QtGui
from vtk.qt4.QVTKRenderWindowInteractor import QVTKRenderWindowInteractor

"""A simple example that uses the QVTKRenderWindowInteractor class."""
# every QT app needs an app
app = QtGui.QApplication(['QVTKRenderWindowInteractor'])

# create the widget
widget = QVTKRenderWindowInteractor()
widget.Initialize()
widget.Start()
# if you dont want the 'q' key to exit comment this.
widget.AddObserver("ExitEvent", lambda o, e, a=app: a.quit())

ren = vtk.vtkRenderer()
widget.GetRenderWindow().AddRenderer(ren)

cone = vtk.vtkConeSource()
cone.SetResolution(8)

coneMapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
coneMapper.SetInput(cone.GetOutput())

coneActor = vtk.vtkActor()
coneActor.SetMapper(coneMapper)

ren.AddActor(coneActor)

# show the widget
widget.show()
# start event processing
app.exec_()
{{< /highlight >}}

Add VTK-Module to Qt-Designer
-----------------------------
If you want to use the `Qt-Designer` for the use with `VTK`, things get a little bit tricky. The `Qt-Designer` comes with our installation of `Qt` under `/usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.8.2/Designer.app` and is a *WYSISWYG*-Editor for `Qt`-UIs. `VTK` already has installed a plugin for it, it just has to be sym-linked into the `Qt-Designer`-Path. You can do this using the following commands, but check your current versions before running these.
{{< highlight bash >}}
cd /usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.8.2/plugins/designer
ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/vtk/5.10.0/plugins/designer/libQVTKWidgetPlugin.dylib libQVTKWidgetPlugin.dylib
{{< /highlight >}}
Now you should have a QVTKWidget available in the `Qt-Designer`. The tricky part begins now. Unfortunately when you try to include a `Qt`-UI which contains a `QVTKWidget`, it fails to compile, because `QVTKWidget` belongs to the Class `QVTKWidget.QVTKWidget`, while the correct class is `vtk.QVTKWidget`. You can fix this using the following workaround.

When you have created your UI using the `Qt-Designer` you can convert it to `Python`-Code using the command
{{< highlight bash >}}
pyuic4 myTestApp.ui > myTestApp_ui.py
{{< /highlight >}}
Import the new file into your Project and change the line
{{< highlight python >}}
from QVTKWidget import QVTKWidget
{{< /highlight >}}
to
{{< highlight python >}}
from vtk import QVTKWidget
{{< /highlight >}}
Now it will compile and run. The tradeoff is that you have to manually change this line every time you want to make changes to the UI using the `Qt-Designer`.
To give an example for a converted UI file which runs, look at the following code.
{{< highlight python >}}
# pythonQtVTKTest.py
import sys
import vtk
from PyQt4 import QtGui
from pythonQtVTKTest_ui import Ui_Form_Main

class StartQT4(QtGui.QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent)
        self.ui = Ui_Form_Main()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)
        self.draw_stuff()    
    def draw_stuff(self):
        # create a donut polydata source
        s = vtk.vtkSuperquadricSource()
        s.ToroidalOn()
        # connect it to a polydatamapper
        m = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
        m.SetInput(s.GetOutput())
        # and finally create an actor to represent the donut in the scene
        a = vtk.vtkActor()
        a.SetMapper(m)

        # the renderer is the 3D scene
        ren = vtk.vtkRenderer()
        ren.AddActor(a)
        # renderwindow to contain the 3D scene
        rw = vtk.vtkRenderWindow()
        rw.AddRenderer(ren)
        self.ui.qvtkWidget.GetRenderWindow().AddRenderer(ren)

        # we want the user to interact
        iren = vtk.vtkRenderWindowInteractor()
        iren.SetRenderWindow(rw)

        # get the whole business going
        iren.Initialize()
        rw.Render()
        #iren.Start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
    myapp = StartQT4()
    myapp.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

**If anyone knows a simpler solution to this, please post it in the comments!**

Using MacTeX and Homebrew
-------------------------

Just a short footnote for those of you who use `MacTeX`. `MacTeX` stores it's files under `/usr/local/texlive` next to the `Homebrew` stuff. They coexist peaceful next to each other, you just have to apply some diplomacy using the following command [[6]](https://github.com/ThinkRuby/thinkruby/wiki/).
{{< highlight bash >}}
sudo chown -R $USER:staff /usr/local
{{< /highlight >}}
You might also consult the `brew doctor`, he will tell you what to do.

Thats it

Thank you for reading, I hope these instructions help you in some way. Please feel free to leave a comment. Have a nice day!
