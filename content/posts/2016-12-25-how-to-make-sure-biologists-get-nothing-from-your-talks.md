*There are many mistakes to make when speaking to people that do not share your profession. Time to get inspired.*

I recently listen to *many* talks. The majority are not worth the time invested. Recently, I gave a talk that summarized my concern on how disconnected computer science and biology is in the genetics field.

Computer scientists are these pesky number crunchers that are incapable of explaining properly what they do. Biologists stop thinking after they see a sum sign in a formula and do not make an effort to understand basics of computer science. These, exaggerated, are the stereotypes we struggle with. While neither of them are true, they, at the very core, touch a truth: Communication between the fields is tough and requires a lot of empathy and sympathy.

I had the pleasure to also attend some computer science talks that are meant to teach biologists how they can improve their workflow and use various tools. 

Here I summarized my key observations on how to efficiently disconnect biologists from your computer science talks:

- Speak a technical computer science language
- Abstract problems as much as possible
- Explain algorithms instead of problems they solve
    - Explain as many algorithms as possible
- Same for file formats: refer to them instead of the information they contain
- Go into details of the algorithms, especially how they fast they perform. 
    - Do *not* spare on memory usage information
- Tell people in which language tools are written in. Biologists are very religious on programming languages. Again, talk a *lot* about performance.
    - Everybody should use `<insert_random_programming_language_here>`
- Jump a lot between analysis steps and make it as abstract as possible
    - Examples are for beginners and the weak
- Scare people from programming stuff on their own because of all the things they can do wrong
- Jump between problems quickly
- Try not to make yourself obsolete

When creating the talk, always ask yourself: *How can I widen the gap wherever possible and disconnect myself from the reality of the audience*
