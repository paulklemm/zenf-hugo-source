*An incomplete how-to on casting confusion and frustration on your audience.*

Sympathy and empathy between computer scientists and biologists cracks down the wall between the disciplines. Still, many talks celebrate the differences and are another brick in said wall.

Here I summarize observations on how to efficiently disconnect biologists from your computer science talks:

- Speak a technical computer science language
- Abstract problems as much as possible
- Explain algorithms instead of problems they solve
- Explain as many algorithms as possible
- Same for file formats: refer to them instead of the information they contain
- Go into details of said algorithms, especially on how they perform
- Do *not* spare on memory usage information
- Tell people in which language tools are written in (Biologists are very religious with programming languages)
- Everybody should use `<insert random programming language here>`
- Jump a lot between analysis steps and make them as abstract as possible
- Avoid examples, they benefit only beginners and the stupid
- Scare people from programming on their own because of all the things they can do wrong
- Jump between problems quickly
- Try not to make yourself obsolete

When you craft the talk, always ask yourself: *How can I widen the gap between the sciences and how can I disconnect myself from the audiences reality?*

Feel free to add suggestions in the comments.
